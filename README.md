1. Copy the repo first (top right corner there is a green button labelled "Code". Click on that button and then select the HTTPS clone link

2. Press Windows + r key on your keyboard to open the run interface and enter the word "cmd" and press enter to get the command prompt

   - *You will then see a line similar to this in the command prompt:*

```
C:\Users\User>

// "User" will be the name of the username you are logged in under
```

4. After getting the above prompt on your command prompt, please change directory to Desktop, as that is where the JAVA-Testing file will be saved by default!
   - *To change the directory to your desktop, enter the following after the step 2 codeblock*

```
cd Desktop

//this 'cd' changes directory to Desktop resulting in:

C:\Users\User\Desktop>
```
