Chapter 9) Objects and Classes

9.1: Introduction
- Can use OOP for 'reusable software'

9.2: Defining Classes for Objects
- OOP involves programming using objects
- instances are often referred to as objects (interchangeable)

state of an object - properties / attributes (aka datafields)
Behavior of an object - represented through methods

class - a contract that defines an object's (instance's) data fields and methods

instantiation - creating an instance (object)

constructor - a special method in a class which allows for the creation of an instance of the class

Unified Modeling Language (UML) - notation of a class diagram that separates the class and its methods from its instances

9.3: Defining Classes and Creating Objects

client (of a class) - the (OG) class that uses another class to run in the main method of the OG class
    ** basically a class that uses another class is called this

public class - since you can put multiple classes in a single file, only one class can be public which is determined by the name of the file
    ** all other classes must be private

9.4: Constructing Objects Using Constructors

- constructors have no return type (not even void)

- invoked using the new operator

no-arg constructor - constructor with no args

default constructor - a public no-arg constructor with an empty body which is implicitly designed ONLY if a class has no explicitly defined constructor

9.5: Accessing Objects via Reference Variables

9.5.1 - Reference Variables and Reference Types

reference variable - contains references to the objects through the usage of a variable

    e.g.
    ClassName objectRefVar;

reference type - a var of the class type that can reference an instance (object) of the class

9.5.2 - Accessing and Object's Data and Methods

- after instance (object) is created, it's data fields and methods can be invoked using the dot operator (.)

    e.g.
    objectRefVar.dataField

    or

    objectRefVar.method(args)

instance variable - a field that is dependent on a specific instance (object)

Instance method - needs an (instance) object of class to be created before getting called
                + need to create object for this, thus often has no args

Static methods - can just be called without creation of object
                + cannot create object for this method type !!!
                + usually has args!! (doesn't always have to have args)
                + also has the keyword STATIC

9.5.3 - Reference Data Fields and the Null Value

null value - is a literal like the boolean literals true and false, which is used as a literal for a reference type (object refvar basically)

NullPointerException - common runtime error which occurs when you invoke a method on a reference var with a null value

9.5.4 - Differences between Variables of Primitive Types and Reference Types

    primitive types - are literal values

    reference types - are references to objects, etc.
        ** holds a reference to where the contents of the object type are stored in memory

9.6: Using Classes from the Java Library

9.6.1 - The Date Class

    Method(s):

    +Date()                     Constructs a Date object for the current time.

    +Date(elapseTime: long)     Constructs a Date object for a given time in
                                milliseconds elapsed since January 1, 1970, GMT.

    +toString(): String         Returns a string representing the date and time.

    +getTime(): long            Returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, GMT

    +setTime(elapseTime: long): void    Sets a new elapse time in the object

9.6.2 - The Random Class

    Method(s):

    +Random()                   Constructs a Random object with the current time as its seed.

    +Random(seed: long)         Constructs a Random object with a specied seed

    +nextInt(): int             Returns a random int value

    +nextInt(n: int): int       Returns a random int value between 0 and n (excluding n).

    +nextLong(): long           Returns a random long value.

    +nextDouble(): double       Returns a random double value between 0.0 and 1.0 (excluding 1.0)

    +nextFloat(): float         Returns a random float value between 0.0F and 1.0F (excluding 1.0F).

    +nextBoolean(): boolean     Returns a random boolean value.

9.6.3 - The Point2D Class

    Method(s):

    +Point2D(x: double, y: double)          Constructs a Point2D object with the specied x- and y-coordinates.

    +distance(x: double, y: double): double Returns the distance between this point and the specied point (x, y).

    +distance(p: Point2D): double           Returns the distance between this point and the specied point p.

    +getX(): double                         Returns the x-coordinate from this point

    +getY(): double                         Returns the y-coordinate from this point

    +midpoint(p: Point2D): Point2D          Returns the midpoint between this point and point p.

    +toString(): String                     Returns a string representation for the point.

Relevant code:
TestPoint2D.java

9.7: Static Variables, Constants, and Methods

Static variables (class variables) - are often shared by the entire class, and are initialized in value

Instance variables (member / member variable) - tied to specific instance of class, not shared with objects in same class
    **(no initialized value)
    **(also declared outside methods)

Instance data fields - often are just data type followed by var = value !!

Instance Method v. Static Method

Instance Method
1. Can invoke instance method (instance method need an object/instance created of the class therefore, can chain instance methods)
2. Can access instance variable (instance variables need instance of a class as well, therefore can be accessed)
3. Can invoke static method (static method can be invoked anywhere in the entire class)
4. Can access static data field (static data fields shared by entire class)

Static Method
1. Cannot invoke instance method ^^ look at above reasoning
2. Cannot access instance variable
3. Can invoke static method
4. Can access static data field

Relevant code:
Circle.java
TestCircleWithStaticMembers.java

9.8: Visibility Modifiers

- public visibility modifier used to denote they can be accessed from any other class

package-private (or package-access) - when no visibility modifier is used, by default the classes, methods, and data fields are accessible by any class in the same package

Public modifiers - Allows for access of member (class) from inside and outside pkg

    Syntax of package calling (before class and all imports):

    package "PackageName";

Private modifiers - Allows for access of data fields in own class

Protected modifiers - Allows for access of member in its own package

private constructor - only should be used when you want to prohibit the user from creating an instance of the class

9.9: Data Field Encapsulation

Data Field Encapsulation - to prevent direct modifications of data fields,
declare data fields private using the private modifier!!

- Often, you need to retrieve and modify data fields, to accomplish this with private data fields, you use a getter method.

e.g. of Accessor

    public returnType getPropertyName(); // accessor (getter)

    public boolean isPropertyName(); // e.g. of a boolean accessor

e.g. of Setter

    public void setPropertyName(dataType propertyValue)

Relevant code:
Circle.java (for CircleWithPrivateDataFields)
TestCircleWithPrivateDataFields.java

9.10: Passing Objects to Methods

- Objects can be passed as param for methods
    ** passing an object is actually passing the reference of the object

Pass-by-value - the one mode of passing arguments that java uses

Relevant code:
TestPassObject.java


9.11: Array of Objects

- an array can hold objects as well as primitive-type values

Syntax:
    Circle[] circleArray = new Circle[10];

    // this stmnt declares and creates an array of 10 circle objects
   to initialize (objects/instances), you can use a for loop

   for (int i = 0; i < circleArray.length; i++) {
    circleArray[i] = new Circle();

*when array of objects created using new operator, each element in array is
ref variable with default value null

**printf is print formatting**
    - can check formatting documentation whilst using printf, useful for formatting

Relevant code:
TotalArea.java

9.12: Immutable Objects & Classes
- occassionally it is desirable to create an object whose contents cannot be changed once object is created
    - "immutable" class & object
    - if class is immutable, all data fields must be private w/ no public setter methods

9.13: The Scope of Variables

local variable - a variable defined inside a method

- the scope of a class's variables is the entire class, regardless of where they are declared

- as long as a class variable doesn't interfere with another variables initialization in the scope of the class, the class variable can be declared anywhere
    ** e.g. local variables in another method aren't affected

hidden variable - if local var has same name as class var, the local var takes precedence and class var is hidden

9.14: This key-word to reference data fields

- the this key-word refers to the object itself

- the this key-word is also used to reference the object's instance variables

9.14.1 - Using this to Reference Data Fields

- the this-keyword gets rid of the hidden variable which is created through the creation of a local variable in a another method
    ** allows for access of a hidden instance variable
    ** THIS IS A GOOD PRACTICE

- a hidden static variable can be accessed using ClassName.staticVariable reference

9.14.2 - Using this to Invoke a Constructor

- the this keyword can be used to invoke another constructor from within a constructor

Summary:

1. Class is a template for objects and defines properties of instances(objects) and their behaviors through methods like constructors, etc.

2. Classes are a data type to declare objRefVar, which holds a ref var of the object class

3. Object is an instance of a class, you create an object using the new operator and use the dot operator to access its appropriate data fields and methods

4. Intance variable/ method belongs to an instance of class, therefore they are associated with specific objects
    Static variable is a local variable tht is shared by all instances of class.
    A static method can be called without the creation of an instance of a class

5. Every instance of a class can access the class's static var and methods

6. Visibility modifiers specify how class, method, and data are accessed
    e.g.
    public - accessible to all clients
    private - only accessbile inside the class

7. Accessor (getter) method or setter (mutator) to enable clients to see / modify data

8. A getter signature
    public returnType getPropertyName() {}

   A setter signature
    public void setPropertyName(dataType propertyValue) {}

9. Parameters passed to methods using pass-by-value. Parameter of primitive type actual value is passed, reference type reference of object is passed

10. Array is an object that can contian primitive types of object types. When array is created, the elements by default are null

11. Immutable objects cannot be modified. To prevent the modification of an object, create immutable class

12. Scope of static and instance variables is the entire class, regardless of where they are declared. (they are class var)
    ** local variables only have scope of certain method they are in

13. this keyword can be used to refer to the calling object. Also is used inside a constructor to invoke another constructor of the same class

Chapter 10) Object-Oriented Thinking

10.1: Introduction

- class design

- procedural programming v. object-oriented programming

10.2: Class Abstraction and Encapsulation

class abstraction - separates class implementation from how the class is used

contract - a combo of class fields, methods, and constructors

class encapsulation - details of a class's implementation are encapsulated and hidden from the user

Abstract data type (ADT) - class's type b/c class instantiated, but you don't need to know what goes on in the background

Relevant code:
TestLoanClass.java
Loan.java

10.3: Thinking in Objects

- method design
    ** couples data and methods into objects
    ** this leads to focus on objects and the operations on objects

object-oriented paradigm vs. procedural

    procedural paradigm - focuses on the design of methods

    object-oriented paradigm - couples data and methods together into objects
        ** combines power of procedural paradigm that integrates data w/ operations

Relevant code:
UseBMIClass.java
BMI.java

10.4: Class Relationships

10.4.1 - Association

    - relations implemented using data fields
        **different classes access another class which they share in common**
    - general binary relationship which describes an activity between two classes
    - can implement associations using data fields and methods

    ** The UML diagrams for association follows certain rules:

        - boxes to represent classes which have solid lines connecting it to another class
        - a filled-in triangle above the solid lines which labels the relationship between the classes
        - a role name for the class which goes under the solid line connecting the class (optional)
        - multiplicity on top of the solid lines next to the class they show the limits for
            ** for a class connected on multiple sides, the multiplicity goes on the top right
            ** for a class on the verymost right, the multiplicity goes on the left above the solid line connecting the class
                ^^ vice versa for vermost left as well

            Syntax:

            m..n (5..60)



multiplicity - placed at side of class to speicify how many of the class's objects are involved in the relationship in UMl

10.4.2 - Aggregation and Composition

Aggregation - a special form of association that may exist between objects of same class
    - represents ownership relationship between two objects'
    - models a "has-a" relationship

Aggregating object - the owner object

Aggregating class - aggregating object's class

Aggregated object - subject object

Aggregated class - subject object's class

Composition - aggregation between two objects if the existence of the aggregated object is dependent on the aggregating object

    e.g.

       Student has a name, composition (because name is aggregated obj dependent on the aggregating obj student)

       Student has an address, aggregation (because address is aggregated obj that is NOT dependent on the aggregating obj student // basically the Address object can exist on its own)

If aggregated obj dependent on aggregating obj --> COMPOSITION

If aggregated obj is NOT dependent on aggregating obj --> AGGREGATION

    - the OWNER object is called an aggregating object and its class is called an aggregating class
    - the SUBJECT object is called an aggregated object, and its class is called an aggregated class
    - this is called composition if the existence of the aggregated object is dependent on the aggregating object
    - it implies one object exclusive ownership

    - a filled black diamond attached to aggregating class represents composition

    - an unfilled white diamond attached to aggregating class represents aggregation

    e.g.
    public class Person {

    private Person supervisor;

    }
    // exemplifies a has-a relationship


10.5: Case Study: Designing the Course Class

Relevant code:
TestCourse.java
Course.java

10.6: Case Study: Designing Class for Stacks

stack - data structure that holds data in a last-in, first out fashion
    ** or a first-in, last-out fashion

Relevant code:
TestStackOfIntegers.java
StackOfIntegers.java

Miscellaneous Notes:

public keyword - declare's member's access as public

static keyword - used to share same var or method of given class (mostly for memory management)

void keyword - denotes that a method does not have a return type

API - application programming interface (offering service to other software)

10.7: Processing Primitive Data Type Values as Objects

    - primitive data type values are not objects
    (wrapping data type into object)
    e.g.
        - int to Integer
        - double to Double
        - char to Character

Using these wrapper classes, you can process primitive data types as objects
    e.g. of Wrapper classes in java.lang package
    - Boolean
    - Character
    - Double
    - Float
    - Byte
    - Short
    - Integer
    - Long

Each of these numeric wrapper classes contain a method to "convert" objects into primitive types"
    e.g.
    doubleValue(), floatValue(), intValue(), longValue(), shortValue(), byteValue()

Can construct wrapper object from primitive data type or from string
    e.g.
    new Double(5.0) = new Double("5.0")

Instances of wrapper classes are immutable, meaning once the objects are created, their values cannot be changed

Each numeric wrapper class has MAX_VALUE(Byte, Short, Integer, and Long)
Each numeric wrapper class has MIN_VALUE
    **MIN_VALUE shows minimum from byte, short, int, and long
    **MIN_value shows minimum POSITIVE float and double

Each numeric wrapper class contains doubleValue(), floatValue(), intValue(), longValue(), and shortValue()
    - returns double, float, int, long, or short

    Syntax:

    new Double(12.4).intValue() // returns 12
    new Integer(12).doubleValue() // returns 12.0

Numeric wrapper class also contains compareTo method which returns 1, 0, or -1
Based off if the number is greater than, equal to, or less than the other number

e.g.
new Double(12.4).compareTo(new Double(12.3)); // returns 1


static valueOf methods
    - this method creates a new object initialized to the value represented by the specified string

    e.g.
    Double doubleObject = Double.valueOf(12.4);

static parsing methods
    - Each numeric wrapper class hass two overloaded parsing methods to parse a numeric string
      into an appropriate numeric value based on 10 or any radix (2 for binary, 8 for octal, 16 for hexadecimal)

    e.g.
    public static parseInt (String s)
    public static int parseInt (String s, int radix)

    Integer.parseInt("11, 2"); // returns 3 because of binary

    ** You can also convert a decimal number into hex number using format method

    e.g.

    String.format("%x", 26); // returns 1A

10.8: Automatic Conversion Between Primitive Types and Wrapper Class Types

boxing - conversion of a primitive value to a wrapper object

autoboxing - when the compiler automatically boxes a primitve value in a context requiring an object

unboxing - conversion of a wrapper object to a primitive value

autounboxing - when the compiler automatically unxboxes an object in a context requiring a primitive value

e.g.:
    Integer intObject = new Integer(2); (is equal to)
    ^classObj ^objRefVar            ^primitive value
                ^wrapper object

    Integer intObject = 2;

    **this is due to autoboxing**

    int i = 1; (is equal to)
    Integer i = new Integer(1);

    **this is due to autounboxing


10.9: The BigInteger and BigDecimal Classes

- can be used to represent integers or decimal numbers of any size and precision
**contained in the java.math package is immutable

- BigInteger can represent an integer of any size
- Also can create instances of these both using BigInteger(String) or BigDecimal(String)

- used with the methods of add, subtract, multiply, divide, and remainder

- divide method may throw ArithmeticException if result cannot be terminated
** use overloaded **
    divide(BigDecimal d, int scale, int roundingMode)

    e.g.:
    divide(b, 20, BigDecimal.ROUND_UP)

Relevant code:
LargeFactorial.java

10.10: The String Class

- String objects are immutable, it cannot be changed once it is created
    Method(s):
        - charAt(index)
        - length()
        - substring
        - indexOf
        - lastIndexOf
        - equals
        - compareTo
        - trim()
        - toLowerCase()
        - toUpperCase()

10.10.1 - Constructing a String

syntax:
    String newString = new String(stringLiteral);

**You can also create a string from array of characters**

e.g.
    char[] charArray = {'G', 'o', 'o', 'd', ' ', 'D', 'a', 'y'};
    String message = new String(charArray);

10.10.2 - Immutable Strings and Interned Strings

- immutable object; contents cannot be changed
- because strings are immutable, JVM uses unique instance of string literals to improve efficiency and save memory (interned string)
- therefore, even if two string objects have same contents, they are not necessarily equal

e.g.
    String s1 = "Welcome to Java";
    String s2 = new String("Welcome to Java");
    String s3 = "Welcome to Java";

    s1 != s2
    but,
    s1 == s3

10.10.3 - Replacing and Splitting Strings
    Methods:
    - replace
        syntax:
        "Welcome".replace("e", "AB") returns a new string, WABlcomAB.

    - replaceFirst
        syntax:
        "Welcome".replaceFirst("e", "AB") returns a new string, WABlcome.

    - replaceAll
        syntax:
        String s = "a+b$#c".replaceAll("[$+#]", "NNN");
        System.out.println(s);

        regex[$+#] specifies chars to replace: $, +, and #
        thus this prints out aNNNbNNNNNNc

    ** these all return a new string derived from original string without altering the og string

    - split
    ** used to extract tokens from string with specified delimiter(s)
        syntax:
        String[] tokens = "Java#HTML#Perl".split("#");

        for (int i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++)
            System.out.print(tokens[i] + " ");

        displays Java HTML Perl because # is the delimiter and the for loop iterates the array tokens, adding a space in between each word

10.10.4 - Matching, Replacing, and Splitting by Patterns

- often there will be a need to write code that validates user input
    ** a regular expression, or REGEX is a string that describes a pattern for matching a set of strings

    Method(s):
    - matches
    ** matches fixed strings and set of strings that follow a pattern

        syntax:
        "Java".equals("Java");

        "Java is powerful".matches("Java.*")

        ** Java.* is a regex which describes a string pattern that begins with Java followed by any zero of more characters
        or

regex - regular expression that describes a pattern for matching, replacing, or splitting a string

        "440–02–4534".matches("\\d{3}–\\d{2}–\\d{4}")

        ** \\d represents a single digit, \\d{#} represents # digits
        or

        String[] tokens = "Java,C?C#,C++".split("[.,:;?]");

        for (int i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++)
            System.out.println(tokens[i]);

        ** this [.,:;?] specifies a pattern that matches any of the char inside the square brackets, and thus splits the string

        result: Java C C# C++

10.10.5 - Conversion between Strings and Arrays

- strings can be converted into an array and vice versa

- for strings to array of char, use toCharArray method

    syntax:
    char[] chars = "Java".toCharArray();

    char[0] is J
    char[1] is a
    char[2] is v
    char[3] is a

- can also use getChars(int srcBegin, int srcEnd, char[] dst, int dstBegin)
    ** to copy substring of string from index srcBegin to index srcEnd-1 into array dst starting from index dstBegin
    ** gets char from another string from firstNum (inclusive) to nextNum specified, specified array, then adds into specified index

10.10.6 - Converting Characters and Numeric Values to Strings

- convert numbers into strings using overloaded static valueOf method

    syntax:
    String.valueOf(data);

10.10.7 - Formatting Strings

- String class contains format method to return formatted string

    syntax:
    String.format(format, item1, item2, ..., itemn);

    Reference to formatting:
    https://stackabuse.com/how-to-format-a-string-in-java-with-examples/

    Format specifiers:
    %c - Character
    %d - Decimal number (base 10)
    %e - Exponential floating-point number
    %f - Floating-point number
    %i - Integer (base 10)
    %o - Octal number (base 8)
    %s - String
    %u - Unsigned decimal (integer) number
    %x - Hexadecimal number (base 16)
    %t - Date/time
    %n - Newline

    Formatting cmds:
    \b - Insert backspace
    \f - Next line's first character starts to the right of current line's last character
    \n - Insert newline
    \r - Insert carriage return
    \t - Insert tab
    \\ - Insert backslash
    %% - Insert percentage sign

10.11: The StringBuilder and StringBuffer Classes

- these are mutable and can be used where a string is used (THUS CAN BE CHANGED)
- can add, insert, or append new contents into their objects

- methods for modifying the buffer in StringBuffer are synchronized
    ** only one task allowed to execute the methods

- use StringBuffer if class might be accessed by multiple taks (concurrent programming)

- use StringBuilder if class is accessed by single task (no synchronization)
    ** Has three constructors and more than 30 methods to manage the builder and modify the strings in the builder

    syntax:
    StringBuilder(); // empty string builder constructed with capacity of 16

    StringBuilder(capacity: int); // string builder constructed with capacity of specified int

    StringBuilder(s: String);   // string builder constructed with specified string

10.11.1 - Modifying Strings in the StringBuilder

- there are many methods in the stringbuilder class to append, insert, delete, and replace a specified position in string builder

    Method(s)
    +append(data: char[]): StringBuilder    // appends a char array into string builder

    +append(data: char[], oset: int, len: int):
    StringBuilder                           // appends a subarray in data into this string builder

    +append(v: aPrimitiveType): StringBuilder   // appends a primitive-type value as a string to this builder

    +append(s: String): StringBuilder           // appends a string to this string builder

    +delete(startIndex: int, endIndex: int):
    StringBuilder                               // Deletes characters from startIndex to endIndex-1

    +deleteCharAt(index: int): StringBuilder    // deletes a character at a specified index

    +insert(index: int, data: char[], oset: int,
    len: int): StringBuilder                    // inserts a subarray of the data in the array into the builder at the specified index

    +insert(oset: int, data: char[]):
    StringBuilder                               // Inserts data into this builder at the position offset.

    +insert(oset: int, b: aPrimitiveType):
    StringBuilder                               // Inserts a value converted to a string into this builder.

    +insert(oset: int, s: String): StringBuilder   // Inserts a string into this builder at the position offset

    +replace(startIndex: int, endIndex: int, s:
    String): StringBuilder                      // Replaces the characters in this builder from startIndex
                                                   to endIndex – 1 with the specied string

    +reverse(): StringBuilder                   // Reverses the characters in the builder

    +setCharAt(index: int, ch: char): void      // Sets a new character at the specied index in this
                                                   builder

    ** if a string does not need to be changed, use String not StringBuilder **

10.11.2 - The toString, capacity, length, setLength, and charAt Methods

- There are also methods to manipulate string builders and obtain their properties

    Method(s)
    +toString(): String // Returns a string object from the string builder.

    // the toString method when used on a object returns by default ObjectClass@hexadecimal of object hashcode if an overloaded toString is not created
    // this is due to the toString method in the Object class

    +capacity(): int    // Returns the capacity of this string builder.

    +charAt(index: int): char   // Returns the character at the specied index.

    +length(): int  // Returns the number of characters in this builder.

    +setLength(newLength: int): void    // Sets a new length in this builder.

    +substring(startIndex: int): String // Returns a substring starting at startIndex.

    +substring(startIndex: int, endIndex: int): // Returns a substring from startIndex to endIndex – 1.
        String

    +trimToSize(): void // Reduces the storage size used for the string builder.

10.11.3 - Case Study: Ignoring Nonalphanumeric Characters When Checking Palindromes

Relevant code:
PalindromeIgnoreNonAlphanumeric.java // gotta do this in the src

Summary:

1. Procedural paradigm focuses on designing methods. Object-oriented paradigm couples data and methods together in objects.
    Object-oriented programming combines procedural paradigm with dimension of data in operations.

2. Java offers way to wrap primitive data types into an object

3. Java can automatically convert a primitive-type value to corresponding wrapper object & vice versa

4. BigInteger class for computing & processing any size integers. BigDecimal to compute and process floating-point nums with precision

5. String object is immutable.
    interned string object - when the JVM stores two literal strings w/ same character sequence in a single object

6. Regular expression (regex) is a string that describes a pattern for matching a set of strings (match, replace, split)

7. StringBuilder and StringBuffer used to replace String class (b/c they are mutable)
    ** use if the string contents will change
    ** otherwise use String class

Chapter 11) Inheritance and Polymorhpism

11.1: Introduction

Inheritance - the ability to define new classes from existing classes
    ** powerful feature for reusing software

11.2: Superclasses and Subclasses

- Inheritance enables the definition of a general class (superclass) and extend to a subclass

subclass - a class extended from another class
    ** child class / extended class / derived class
    ** inherts all accessible data fields and methods from superclass and may add data fields and methods

Inheritence: You could extend a class at most once (Every class could only have 1 parent)
    ** Inheritence is like what you have with exceptions, where there is one big exception that lets its child classes to extend the parent, and so on, it continues on - like a family tree. 
    ** Using "this" keyword to access your class's constructor, used to initialize the constructor partially. 

superclass - class that another class that extends from
    ** parent class / base class

subtype - type defined by a subclass

is-a relationship - subclass "is-a" part of superclass

** once again, private data fields in a class cannot be accessed from another class
** therefore, subclasses cannot access private data fields in their corresponding superclass

Key Takeaways Regarding Inheritance:

- Subclass is NOT a subset of superclass, instead it has more info and methods than the superclass

- Private data fields in superclass not accessible outside the class, therefore cannot be used directly in subclass
    ** they can be accessed/modified through public accessors/mutators ONLY IF defined in the SUPERCLASS

- Not all is-a relationships should be modeled using inheritance b/c not all subclasses has a is-a relationship w/ others under the same superclass

- Don't extend a class unless the classes have an "is-a" relationship

- Java does not have multiple inheritance, thus you CANNOT derive subclass from several classes
    ** This is called single inheritance, where a subclass can ONLY have one parent

11.3: Using the super Keyword

- when used in a constructor of a subclass, super reference must be the first statement

- the superclass' constructor called by default before the constructor is invoked

- super refers to the superclass (parent) & invokes superclasses methods and constructors

- subclass inherits accessible data fields and methods

    ** this reference can be used to call a superclass constructor or a superclass method

Relevant code:
SimpleGeometricObject.java
CircleFromSimpleGeometricObject.java
RectangleFromSimpleGeometricObject.java
TestCircleRectangle.java

11.3.1 - Calling Superclass Constructors:

- constructors of a superclass are not inherited by a subclass, but they can be invoked using super keyword

    e.g.

    super() or super(args);

    public Circle(double radius, String color, boolean filled) {
        super(color, filled); // this refers to the superclass geometricObject's args constructor
        this.radius = radius;
    }

11.3.2 - Constructor Chaining

- constructor may invoke overloaded constructor(multiple same name constructors, diff param) or superclass constructor

- constructing an instance of a class invokes constructors of all superclasses along inheritance chain until the last constructor along the hierarchy is called
    ** constructor chaining^^

- UML Diagram of: Parent(base) class is super class, child(derived) class is a sub-class

    simple example of constructor chaining:

    1 public class Faculty extends Employee {
    2   public static void main(String[] args) {
    3       new Faculty();
    4   }
    5
    6   public Faculty() {
    7       System.out.println("(4) Performs Faculty's tasks");
    8   }
    9  }
    10
    11  class Employee extends Person {
    12      public Employee() {
    13          this("(2) Invoke Employee's overloaded constructor");
    14          System.out.println("(3) Performs Employee's tasks ");
    15  }
    16
    17      public Employee(String s) {
    18          System.out.println(s);
    19      }
    20  }
    21
    22  class Person {
    23      public Person() {
    24          System.out.println("(1) Performs Person's tasks");
    25      }
    26   }

** if a class is designed to be extended, provide a no-arg constructor to avoid errors

11.3.3 - Calling Superclass Methods

- keyword super can be used to reference method other than constructor in superclass
    ** (parents call their parents, can never call constructor using super.super THIS IS WRONG)
    syntax:

    super.method(args);

    // for a getter method, you can only find objects actual type, and not its parents classs

- You could chain super constructors if the parent has a parent.
    ** everything that belongs to the parent, the parent should print it,
    or get the methods from the parent class instead of doing the operations from a child class, child class should only be reponsible for its own behavior, like providing the toString method.
     
- Using "super" keyword to access the constructor and methods of Parent class
- Superflous 


11.4: Overriding Methods

- to override a method, the method must be defined in the subclass using same signature as its superclass

- we override with the @Override above the method

- we only override because there is ambiguity in regards to the parents class method and the child class method have a same method signature

- Overriding method must have same signature as overridden method and same/compatible return type
    ** signature is part of method declaration, it is the method name + params

- Instance method can be overridden only if it is accessible
    ** private method cannot be overridden

- if a a method is overridden, it cannot be called
8
- Static method can also be inherited but cannot be overridden

// This topic is sort-of confusing, will revisit this in more depth later**

11.5: Overriding vs. Overloading

- overriding is to provide a new implementation for a method in the subclass
    ** if there is a subclass of a superclass with same method signature as the method in the superclass, the subclass method would override the method in the superclass
    ** lose access to parents method, etc.
    ** common practice to often override parents method

- overloading is to define multiple methods w/ the same name but diff signatures
    ** same method name except for params, therefore is overloading
    ** don't lose access to parenets methods, etc.
    ** can use parents method in the childs method by calling it


∵
- overridden methods are in diff classes by inheritance (super / subclass)

- overloaded methods can be either in same class of diff classes by inheritance

- overridden methods have same signature

- overloaded methods have same name but diff param

    syntax:

    public class Circle extends GeometricObject {

        @Override
        public String toString0 {
            return super.toString() + "\n" + "radius is " + radius;
        }
    }

    ** the @Override is called override annotation, which is oft3en placed before the overriding method
        Using this annotation, mistakes can be avoided

    ** override is good to use for equals method

    e.g.

    public boolean equals(className classObjType) {
        ... insert statements here
    }

    public boolean equals(subclassName subclassType) {
        super.equals(subclassType);
    }

11.6: The Object Class and Its toString() Method

- Every class in Java is descended from the java.lang.Object class

    syntax:
    public String toString()

- invoking toString() on object returns a string that describes the object

Common Issue with toString() Method:

    e.g.
    Loan loan = new Loan();
    System.out.println(loan.toString());

    // this displays Loan@15037e5 (binary bs) <- object class + @ + hexadecimal of object

** To avoid this issue, override the toString method in the Object class

11.7: Polymorphism

- means that a var of supertype can refer to subtype object

There are 3 Pillars of OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

1. Data hiding in ENCAPSULATION

2. Inheritance -  your class and other class, your class gets something from the other class (child class gets from the parent class etc.)
    ** inherits attributes and methods from another class
    ** Each class has exactly one parent, something exclusive to JAVA
    ** this is a "IS A" relationship unike composition & aggregation, which are "HAS A" relationships
    ** instance variable - created when object created

    notes:
    ** yes, you can call methods of parent class, but only the public methods
    ** constructor of the parent is called in the 1st stmnt of constructor / if no call to super, compilar puts it in for you
    ** if a subclass is created w/o a superclass but now it has the said parent class, it has additional fields
    ** subclass does inherit private data fields of super class (in regards to the object created)

3. Polymorphism
    ** an object of a subclass can be used wherever its superclass object's reference is used
    ** Uses methods attained from inheritance to perform other tasks

    e.g. Shape myShape = new Rectangle();
        ** as long as subtype class "IS A" object supertype (this is stored in a supertype var) **

        superclass var = subclass object();

    concept is that even though it is restricted by types, must have reference of same type 
        ** (only methods you could call are things of type of the reference),


    Using array of objects to find out if they are siblings

    How to tell if two objects are siblings: assigned an object of subclass to a superclass reference var
        ** Use an array of objects to find out if they are siblings

        e.g. 

        for (Shape shp : listOfShapes) {    // enhanced for-loop

            System.out.println("color: " + shp.getColor());
        }

    ** You can create another method in the superclass to resolve issue of subclass method not running with object of super type as param

Relevant code:
PolymorphismDemo.java // review this code

** This topic is sort-of confusing as well, check back later

11.8: Dynamic Binding:

- determines which method is called based off the actual type

- bascially when compiler decides which method to run at runtime

- a method can be implemented in several classes in inheritance chain. JVM decides which is invoked at runtime

- when compiler cannot compile call/binding at compile time

Which method: overloaded / overridden method is invoked first?

- a variable must be declared a type

declared type - type that declares a var is called vars declared type
    
    type - variables and expressions all have this; e.g. int, double, Object, etc.

    ** var of reference type can hold null or reference to instance of declared type
        ** instance may be created using the constructor of declared type or subtype


actual type - the actual class for object referenced by var (the type pointed to by the var)

- the method that invokes an object is determined by the object's actual type // known as dynamic binding

    e.g. of declared and actual type
    Object o = new GeometricObject();

    ** Object is the declared type
    ** GeometricObject is the actual type b/c o references object created using new GeometricObject()
        ** the toString() method invoked is based off the actual type

Relevant code:
DynamicBindingDemo.java

11.9: Casting Objects and the instanceof operator

- typechecking (of declared an actual type by compiler)
- object reference can be typecast into another object reference

    e.g.

    m(new Student()) (is equals to)

    Object o = new Student();
    m(o);

    // implicit Casting ^^
        ** Legal b/c Student is an instance of Object (upcasting)
        ** Always possible b/c instance of subclass always is an instance of superclass

Q: Why doesn't Student b = o not work?
    A: b/c Student object is instance of Object, but Object is not instance of Student
        ** it is a good practice to ensure the object is an instance of another object (superclass obj is instance of subclass basically)

    To solve this issue that the compiler cannot figure out do:

    Student b = (Student)o

    // explicit casting ^^ (downcasting) ** THIS IS NOT OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING **
        ** Casting insance of superclass to var of subclass must be used to confirm intention of downcasting using the above notation
        ** For this casting to be successful, make sure object cast is an instance of subclass
            ** otherwise, ClassCastException occurs

    ** use instanceof operator to downcast
    e.g.

    void someMethod(Object myObject) {  // assume object is superclass type

        if (myObject instanceof Circle) {   // use instanceof operator to check if superclass type is of subclass type
            System.out.println("The circle diameter is" + ((Circle)myObject).getDiameter());    // use downcasting on superclass type in order to call method from subclass on superclass obj

        }
    }

    /**
    So this method is checking if superclass object myObject is an instance of subclass type Circle
    Then downcasts in the println stmnt using the proper notation
    */

    ** or you can use getClass method to downcast
    (Sokol knows how to do this)

    ** Using downcasting does not create a new object

11.10: The Object's equals Method

- equals(Object) method is useful method definted in the object class

    syntax:

    public boolean equals(other o)
    ^ signature in Object class

    object1.equals(object2);

    default implementation of equals method in Object class:

    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        return this == obj;
    }

    // This checks two reference variables point to the same object using == operator
    // The == operator is used to compare two primitive data-ty[es pr to determine whether two objects have same references
    // the equals method is to test if two objects have the same contents, given that the method is overridden

    // the == operator is stronger than the equals method because the == operator checks if two reference variables refer to the same obj

The equals method is usually overridden and can be done so by this format:

    Syntax:

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object superclassVar) {       // Using a signature like equals(SomeClassName obj) is incorrect use equals(Object obj)
        if (superclassVar instanceof subclassVar) {
            return instanceVar == ((subclassVar)superclassVar).radius;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }


11.11: The ArrayList Class

- ArrayList object can be used to store a list of objects

- Once the array is created, its size is fixed

    Method(s):

    +ArrayList()
    +add(e: E): void                   // Appends a new element e at the end of this list.

    +add(index: int, e: E): void       // Adds a new element e at the specified index in this list.

    +clear(): void                     // Removes all elements from this list

    +contains(o: Object): boolean      // Returns true if this list contains the element o.

    +get(index: int): E                // Returns the element from this list at the specified index.

    +indexOf(o: Object): int           // Returns the index of the firrst matching element in this list.

    +isEmpty(): boolean                // Returns true if this list contains no elements.

    +lastIndexOf(o: Object): int       // Returns the index of the last matching element in this list.

    +remove(o: Object): boolean        // Removes the first element CDT from this list. Returns true
                                          if an element is removed.

    +size(): int                       // Returns the number of elements in this list.

    +remove(index: int): E             // Removes the element at the specied index. Returns
                                          the removed element.

    +set(index: int, e: E): E          // Sets the element at the specified index.



- Arraylist is a generic class with generic type E
    ** Specify concrete type to replace E (concrete type refers to a class which can have an obj instantiated)

    e.g.

    before JDK 7:

    ArrayList<String> cities = new ArrayList<String>();
    concrete type^      ^ here, cities is of concrete type String which replaces E

    after JDK 7:

    ArrayList<String> cities = new ArrayList<>();

Differences and similarities between Arrays and ArrayList

Creation:
String[] a = new String[size];

ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();

** the top under each section is Array and bottom is Arraylist, unless the operation is said to be exclusive to ArrayList)

Accessing:
a[index]

list.get(index);

Updating:
a[index] = "London";

list.set(index, "London");

Returning size:
a.length

list.size();


Adding a new element (exclusive to ArrayList):
list.add("London");

Inserting new element (exclusive to ArrayList):
list.add(index, "London");

Removing an element (exclusive to ArrayList):
list.remove(index);

list.remove(Object);

Removing all elements (exclusive to ArrayList):
list.clear();

More things to know:
- Array is static in size, ArrayList is dynamic in size
    ** however you can use a scanner to read a variety of array sizes, but they will be static still

- Array is fixed length, Arraylist is variable length

- Arrays must have size initialized, ArrayList can be created without specifying its size

- Arrays are much faster in comparison to ArrayList b/c Arrays are of fixed size and the ArrayList has the resize operation in it

- Arrays store objects and primitive types, ArrayList can only hold object types (primitive types get converted into object types)

- Arrays can be iterated using for-loop or for-each loop, ArrayList uses an iterator

- Arrays are not type-safe, ArrayList is type-safe

- Arrays uses length variable to denote length, ArrayList uses size() method to determine size

- Arrays can add elements in using assignment operator, ArrayList uses add() method

- Arrays can be multi-dimensional, ArrayLists are always one dimensional

Relevant code:
TestArrayList.java
DistinctNumbers.java

11.12: Useful Methods for Lists

- Java provides methods for creating list from array, sorting a list, and finding max and min element in list, and shuffling a list

    Method Syntax:

    String[] array = {"red", "green", "blue"};
    ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(array)); // turns Array to ArrayList

    String[] array1 = new Stringp[list.size()]
    list.toArray(array1);   // turns ArrayList into Array

    Integer[] array = {3, 5, 95, 4, 15, 34, 3, 5, 6};
    ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(array));
    java.util.Collections.sort(list);
    System.out.println(list);  // this sorts the Array into an ArrayList of integers that is sorted, from smallest to largest

    ** You can also use the static max and min in the java.util.Collections class to return max and min elements of the list
    e.g.
    System.out.println(java.util.Collections.max(list));

    or

    System.out.println(java.util.Collections.min(list));

    ** You can also use the static shuffle in the java.util.Collections to perform a random shuffle of elements in the list
    e.g.

    java.util.Collections.shuffle(list);
    System.out.println(list);


11.13: Case Study: A Custom Stack Class

Relevant code:
MyStack.java

11.14: The protected Data and Methods

- a protected member of a class can be accessed from a subclass

- you can allow subclasses to access data fields or methods defined in the superclass but not nonsubclasses in different packages

Visibility from least visible to most visible:
1. private
2. default (no modifier)
3. protected
4. public

Modifiers:
    - public (can access: class, package, subclass (same pkg), subclass (diff pkg), World (different package access))
    - protected (can access: class, package, subclass (same pkg), subclass (diff pkg))
    - no modifier (can access: class, package, subclass (same pkg))
    - private (can access: class)

11.15: Preventing Extending and Overriding

- final classes and final methods cannot be extended

- final data field is constant

    ** final keyword can also be used on local variables, making it a constant inside a method

Chapter 12) Exception Handling and Text I/O

12.1: Introduction

- Exceptions are runtime errors
- Exception handling enables a program to deal with runtime errors and continue its normal execution
    e.g.
    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-exception-in-java-with-examples/     // these are built in exceptions (There is a hierarchy of exceptions / NOT A LIST // class notes & slides)
    - ArrayIndexOutOfBounds
    - InputMismatchException, etc.

exception - an object that represents an error or a condition that prevents execution from proceeding normally

12.2: Exception-handling Overview

- exceptions are thrown from a method, and the caller of the method can catch and handle the exception

- program method should never terminate the program, should be up to user
- Java enables a method to throw an exception that be caught and handled by the caller

    syntax:
    public ...
        if (conditional)
            throw new EXCEPTION("output to caller") // exception is an object thrown (specified exeception is dataType in java API)
            // this is the throw statment ^^

    public static void main(String [] args) {

        stmnts...;

        try {
            stmnts / methods...
            // can have stmnt of method that throws exception here as well
        } catch (EXCEPTION catchBlockParameter) {   // catch-block header // catch-block param is usually ex
            code to process exception...
            // usually a print statement
        }

        stmnts...
    }

throwing an exception - the execution of a throw stmnt
    ** exception is an object created from an exception class
- when an exception is thrown, normal execution is interrupted
- "throw an exception" passes an exception from one place to another
    ** the stmnt to invoke the method is in a "try" block

- the try block contains code that is executed in normal circumstances

- the exception is caught by the catch block

- the catch block is executed to handle the exception

** advantage of using exception handling
    - it enables a method to throw an exception to its caller, enabling the caller to handle the exception

- often, methods called do not know what to do in case of an error
    **this is typically the case for library methods
    ** key benefit is separating the detection of error (in called method) from the handling of error (in calling method)

**runtime exceptions don't have to be declared, thus every other exception must be included after the called method param as well as in method body in the called method**

Relevant code:
Quotient.java
QuotientWithIf.java
QuotientWithMethod.java
QuotientWithException.java
InputMismatchExceptionDemo.java

12.3: Exception Types

- the root class for exceptions is java.lang.Throwable

** The class names Error, Exception, and RuntimeException are all exceptions and all of the errors occur at runtime

- you can create own exception classes by extending Eception or a subclass of Exception

- exception classes can be classified into 3 major types:
    1. System errors - thrown by JVM and are represented in the Error class
        (UNCHECKED)
        ** Error class describes internal system errors

    2. Exceptions - represented by Exception class, which describes errors caused by your program and by external circumstances
        ** these errors can be caught and handled by your program

    3. Runtime Exceptions - represented in RuntimeException class - which describes programming errors
        (UNCHECKED)
        runtime exceptions don't have to be declared as usual
            ** runtime exceptions are unchecked exceptions (their subclasses too)

** if its possible to rethrow an exception, it throws it to another method **
    e.g.

    for example, if the exception is in method1 and another method, method2 calls it and it throws exception right after its param in the method signature, and if said method2 is called in another method, the exception travels up the stack
        ** must have checked exceptions (the middle method(s) throws exception)

        **All other exceptions other than runtime and errors are checked exceptions, needing try and catch blocks

    stack diagram is a very good way to trace exception rethrows** also in main, the "throw exception" is optional

Reference:

execptionHierarchy.PNG (this is in the same dir as this txt file)

12.4: More on Exception Handling

- A handler for exception is found through chain of reverse method calls, starting from current method

12.4.1 - Declaring Exceptions

- Often, to declare an exception in a method, you do it in the method header using: throws EXCEPTION after the method params
    ** if there are multiple exceptions to be thrown, go to the next line and do: throws EXCEPTION1, EXCEPTION2, ..., etc. (the exceptions are separated by commas)

12.4.2 - Throwing Exceptions

- program that detects an error which creates an instance of the appropriate exception type

12.4.3 - Catching Exceptions

- catch stmnt and params comes directly after try block

12.4.4 - Getting Information from Exceptions

- exception object has valuable info about exception

    Method(s)

    from java.lang.Throwable, you can get info regarding the exception using these methods:

    +getMessage(): String   // Returns the message that describes this exception object.

    +toString(): String // Returns the concatenation of three strings: (1) the full name of the exception
                           class; (2) ":" (a colon and a space); and (3) the getMessage() method

    +printStackTrace(): void    // Prints the Throwable object and its call stack trace information on the
                                       console.

    +getStackTrace():
    StackTraceElement[] // Returns an array of stack trace elements representing the stack trace
                               pertaining to this exception object.

Relevant code:

TestException.java

12.4.5 - Example: Declaring, Throwing, and Catching Exceptions

Relevant code:

CircleWithException.java
TestCircleWithException.java


12.5: The finally Clause

- executed regardless if exception occurred or not
    ** if no exceptions are arised, finally stmnts are executed and next stmnt after try stmnt is executed
    ** if stmnt causes an exception in try block that is caught in the catch block, rest of try is skipped and catch is exected and the finally is then executed as well
    ** if one stmnt causes an exception that is not caught in catch block(s), the other try stmnts are skipped and finally is executed

    ** finally block executes even if return statement prior to reaching the finally block

- should come after try/catch block which catch checked exceptions

12.6: When to Use Exceptions

- a method should throw an exception if the error needs to be handled by its caller

12.7: Rethrowing Exceptions

- occurs when the handler cannot process the exception, or wants to let it's caller be notified of the exception

    e.g.

    try {
        stmnts...
    } catch (Exception ex) {
        stmnts...
        throw ex;
    }
    // in this code snippet, throw ex rethrows exception to caller so other handlers in  caller can process the exception

12.8: Chained Exceptions

chained exception - throwing an exception along with another exception

- when in the try block of the exception handling there is another method that throws an exception, and then there is the catch block to catch another exception as well

Relevant code:
ChainedExceptionDemo.java

12.9: Defining Custom Exception Classes

- You can define a custom exception class by extending the Exception class

    Syntax:

    public class ClassName extends Exception {
                    ^ This is the Exception you create, can be any name
    }


Relevant code:
InvalidRadiusException.java
TestCircleWithCustomException.java

12.10: The File Class

- file class obtains file/directory properties, deletes and renames files/directories, and creates directories

Absolute file name (full name) - file name with complete path and drive letter

directory path - everything from absolute file name except the file name itself

Relative file name - the file name without the path

- file class does NOT contain methods for reading and writing file contents

    Method(s):

    +File(pathname: String)
    +File(parent: String, child: String)
    +File(parent: File, child: String)
    +exists(): boolean
    +canRead(): boolean
    +canWrite(): boolean
    +isDirectory(): boolean
    +isFile(): boolean
    +isAbsolute(): boolean
    +isHidden(): boolean
    +getAbsolutePath(): String
    +getCanonicalPath(): String
    +getName(): String
    +getPath(): String
    +getParent(): String
    +lastModied(): long
    +length(): long
    +listFile(): File[]
    +delete(): boolean
    +renameTo(dest: File): boolean
    +mkdir(): boolean
    +mkdirs(): boolean

** directory separator in Windows is a "\", but in a string literal it should be written as "\\"

** never use absolute file names in program
    ** this is because the code may not work in other Operating Systems (e.g. Linux, OS, etc)

** forward slashes work on all platforms

    e.g.

    new File("image/us.gif");

Relevant code:
TestFileClass.java

12.11: File Input and Output

- use the Scanner class for reading text data from a file
- use PrintWriter class for writing text data to a file

- File object encapsulates the properties of a file/path but does not contain the methods to write/read data to/from a file

12.11.1 - Writing Data Using PrintWriter

    Syntax:

    PrintWriter output = new PrintWriter(filename);

    Method(s):

    +PrintWriter(lename: String)
    +print(s: String): void
    +PrintWriter(le: File)
    +print(c: char): void
    +print(cArray: char[]): void
    +print(i: int): void
    +print(l: long): void
    +print(f: f loat): void
    +print(d: double): void
    +print(b: boolean): void

    Also contains the overloaded
    println methods.

    Also contains the overloaded
    printf methods.

- must use close() method to close the PrintWriter object
    ** or else you risk the data not being saved properly in the file

Relevant code:
WriteData.java

12.11.2 - Closing Resources Automatically Using try-with-resources

- Since programmers often forget to close the file, the JDk (java development kit) provides new try-with resources syntax that auto closes files

    Syntax:

    try (declare and create resources) {
        rerources to process the file...
    }

Relevant code:
WriteDataWithAutoClose.java

12.11.3 - Reading Data Using Scanner

- Scanner used to read strings and primitive values from console

- it can also read input from file from console
    ** it breaks input into tokens delimited by whitespace

    Syntax:

    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    // this is for primitive input from console

    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File(filename));

    or

    File file = new File(path);
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(file);

    Method(s):

    +Scanner(source: File)
    +Scanner(source: String)
    +close()
    +hasNext(): boolean
    +next(): String
    +nextLine(): String
    +nextByte(): byte
    +nextShort(): short
    +nextInt(): int
    +nextLong(): long
    +nextFloat(): float
    +nextDouble(): double
    +useDelimiter(pattern: String):
    Scanner

Relevant code:
ReadData.java

12.11.4 - How Does Scanner Work?

- has token based / line based input

    token based - nextInt(), next(), nextDouble(), etc.

    ** by default, the delimiters are whitespace, to overcome this do:

    useDelimiter(String regex)  // used to set up a new pattern for delimiters

    line-based - reads line ending with line separator

    ** Windows OS and Linux OS differ b/c their line separators are different, to overcome this do:

    String lineSeparator = System.getProperty("line.separator");

12.11.5 - Case Study: Replacing Text

Relevant code:
ReplaceText.java

12.12: Reading Data from the Web

- you can read data from a file on the web

URL - uniform resourse locator -- the unique address for a file on the web

    e.g.

    www.google.com/index.html
    ^^ the URL for the file index.html located on the Google web server

- for application program to read data from URL, first create URL object using java.net.URL class

    Syntax:

    public URL(String spec) throws MalformedURLException

    e.g.

    try {
        URL url = new URL("http://www.google.com/index.html");
    } catch (MalformedURLExceptiuon ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

MalformedURLException - thrown if the URL string has a syntax error

Relevant code:
readFileFromURL.java

Chapter 13) Abstract Classes and Interfaces

13.1: Introduction

- like a superclass defines common behavior for related subclasses, an interface is used to define common behavior for classes

interface - used to define common behavior for classes (unrelated classes as well)

13.2: Abstract Classes

- abstract class cannot be used to create objects
    ** however they can contain abstract methods that can be called by concrete subclasses

abstract method - method w/ no code, just for type usage, superclass method that is to be overridden by subclass methods
    ** this initializes fields of constructors of subclasses

    Syntax:

    public abstract returnType methodName();

        ** for the children, add @Override before every abstract method inherited by subclasses

    ** as soon as you have single abstract method in a class, the class needs to be declared abstract

    Syntax:

    public abstract class className {
        ... add data fields and methods here
    }

    abstract class - should only have abstract class so children can inherit methods
        - the children inherit all methods, so they can call methods

        - the compiler sticks in super via the children/subclasses

        - NOTHING happens to the constructors, instantiation just can't be done normally through the abstract class
            ** to create object of abstract class, use polymorphism where subclass type is an object super type

        - can still have regular methods

        - you can use this in a collection of data (array, etc.)

        - in the subclass constructors, you should use super with the params from the args to instantiate


    concrete class - can instantiate objects (no special syntax)

Relevant code:
GeometricObject.java
Circle.java
Rectangle.java

13.2.1 - Why Abstract Methods?

** Using polymorphism, we can have two different subclass objects of a superclass and utilize abstract methods in order to override the parents abstract method(s)

Relevant code:
TestGeometricObject.java

13.2.2 - Interesting Points about Abstract Classes

- all abstract methods in abstract superclass must be implemented in its subclasses or else the subclass has to be declared abstract
    ** abstract methods are nonstatic

- an abstract class cannot be instantiated, but it can still have constructors
    ** these constructors can only be called by subclass using super(params) as the first statement in the subclass constructor

- class containing abstract methods has to be abstract
    ** some abstract classes can be created with no abstract methods // this is used as a base class for defining subclasses

- subclass can override a method from superclass to define it as abstract. (unusual practice)

- subclass can be abstract even if its superclass is concrete

- cannot creaete instance of abstract class using new operator, but an abstract class can be used as a data type

13.3: Case Study: the Abstract Number Class

Relevant code:
LargestNumber.java

13.4: Case Study: Calendar and GregorianCalendar

Relevant code:
TestCalendar.java

13.5: Interfaces

interface - a class-like construct for defining common operations for objects

    Syntax:
    modifier interface InterfaceName {
        // constant declarations
        // abstract method signatures
    }

- interface is like a special class in java
    ** each one is compiled into separate bytecode file, like regular class
    ** Can use interface same way as abstract class
        - can use interface as data type for a ref var as a result of casting

    ** the modifiers in an interface can be omitted

- an interface can be implemented through keyword implements

    e.g.
    class Chicken extends Animal implements Edible {    // Edible is the interface

Interface methods using the keyword default

- provides a default implementation for method in interface
- class that used interface can use default implementation or override the method w/ new implementation

- allows a adding of a new method in an interface w/ default implementation w/o rewriting code for classes that implement the interface

    Syntax:

    public interface A {

        public default void doSomething() {
            System.out.println("Do something");
        }

        public static int getAValue() {
            return 0;
        }
    }

Relevant code:
TestEdible.java

13.6: The Comparable Interface

- defines the compareTo method for comparing objects

- to find out if two objects are comparable, Java provides the Comparable interface

    Syntax:

    package java.lang;

    public interface Comparable<E> {
        public int compareTo(E o);
    }

- this method determines the order of this object with specified object o and returns a negative int, 0, or a positive int if the object is less than, equal to, or greater than o

- is a generic interface of type E which is replaced by concrete type when implementing this interface

Relevant code:
SortComparableObjects.java
ComparableRectangle.java
SortRectangles.java

13.7: The Cloneable Interface

- an interface which specifies if an object can be cloned

    Syntax:

    package java.lang;

    public interface Cloneable {
    }
    // this interface is empty

marker interface - an interface with an empty body
    ** Used to denote that a class possessed certain properties

- class which implements Cloneable interface is marked cloneable, and its objects can be cloned using the clone() method defined in the Object class

header for clone method in the Object class:

    Syntax:
    protected native Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException;

native keyword - indicates that this method is not written in Java but it implemented in the JVM

Relevant code:
House.java

13.8: Interfaces vs. Abstract Classes

- a class can implement multiple interfaces, but it can only extend one superclass

13.9: Case Study: The Rational Class

Relevant code:
Rational.java
TestRationaClass.java

13.10: Class-Design Guidelines

- used to design sound classes


Will figure out where to put these notes later:

Keywords:
    - implements
    - instanceof
    - native
    - abstract
    - extends
    - super
    - this
    - more to be added...
